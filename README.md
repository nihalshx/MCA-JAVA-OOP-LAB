<h1 align="center">📚 MCA-JAVA-OOP-LAB🚀</h1>


Welcome to the **MCA 2nd Semester OOP Lab Repository**! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

> _A curated collection of Java programs and lab exercises crafted during my journey at MES College of Engineering, Kuttippuram._

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Java programs designed to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

- 🧩 Classes and Objects
- 🏛️ Inheritance (Single, Multilevel)
- 🔄 Method Overloading
- 🧑‍💻 Interfaces and Packages
- 📝 String Manipulation
- 🧮 Matrix Operations
- 🔍 Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- 💡 Real-world problem solving (e.g., Bill Generation, Employee Info)

Each folder contains source code and, where applicable, sample input/output or explanations.
