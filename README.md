Welcome to the **MCA 2nd Semester OOP Lab Repository**! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

> _A curated collection of Java programs and lab exercises crafted during my journey at MES College of Engineering, Kuttippuram._

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Java programs designed to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

- 🧩 Classes and Objects
- 🏛️ Inheritance (Single, Multilevel)
- 🔄 Method Overloading
- 🧑‍💻 Interfaces and Packages
- 📝 String Manipulation
- 🧮 Matrix Operations
- 🔍 Searching and Sorting Algorithms
- 💡 Real-world problem solving (e.g., Bill Generation, Employee Info)

Each folder contains source code and, where applicable, sample input/output or explanations.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Browse** to the relevant folder for the program you want to explore.
2. **Open** the `.java` files in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. **Compile and run** using the Java compiler:
   ```sh
   javac FileName.java
   java ClassName
   ```
4. **Refer to** `All_Code.pdf` for a consolidated view of all programs.
